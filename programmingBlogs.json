        "description": "1. Choose a Programming Language: Firstly, you need to choose a programming language that you are most comfortable with and learn its syntax. It can be anything C, C++, Java, Python, or any programming language. 2. Understand the Concept of Time and Space Complexity: In most cases, there is more than one solution that exists to a problem, so you need to come up with the best solution, i.e an optimal one, and that's decided by how much time and space an algorithm takes to solve a problem. So it's really important to learn about these two concepts to write an optimal solution to the problem. 3. Learning the Fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms: DSA is the heart of programming and you can not ignore it while solving coding problems in competitive programming. Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Trie, Graph, Sorting, Recursion, Dynamic Programming all these basic building blocks of DSA will help you to become a good programmer. 4. Take the Challenge and Solve Coding Problems: Finally, you need to take part in coding challenges on different coding platforms. Before participating in a contest it would be great if you practiced for some challenges on your own and then participate there. Start from the basic level and once you build the confidence, get out of your comfort zone and gradually try to solve the complex problems. 5. Practice and Do it Regularly: Your patience, dedication, and consistency are very important for becoming a good competitive programmer. Keep practicing the coding questions every single day. The important thing is to do it regularly. Programming needs a lot of patience, so don't get discouraged, or DO NOT GIVE UP IF YOU GET WRONG ANSWERS. This is the point where most people lose interest in programming. Keep trying for a day, week, or months if a voice inside your head says that your method is right. If you can't find a solution google it, ask for help if you don't get the topic, and read the various approaches that coders took to solve the problem but don't quit. Also, you can read the solution only if you are completely sure that you have made a lot of effort and now you can't do anything. But make sure to code again the same problem. You will start improving day by day only and only if you maintain your consistency and don't stop.",

        "title": "5 points to improve your programming logic",
        "description": "Logic in programming is a fundamental key to being a good developer. The use of algorithms will vary considering what job you have. If you are a web designer probably you are not going to deal with complex algorithms, but if you are a front-end developer maybe a little more, and if you are a back-end developer much more. So here are 5 points to improve your logic in programming. 1. Think to solve: Programming is about solving problems, a good technique is to split the big problem into small ones to focus on each problem in a better way, you can use pseudocode in a program or a simple paper. 2. Practice: The most important point is this: practice. An algorithm is nothing more than an ordered and finite set of operations that we carry out for the sole purpose of finding a solution to a problem. So try to practice simple problems to get a better logic. 3. Learn about Data Structures and Algorithms: Learning about structures will give you a better plan to focus your problems and have efficient software. You can play games like Chess and practice Mathematics. 4. Learn programming paradigms: A very good point is to learn programming paradigms. Probably one of the most programming paradigms is The Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP). A programming paradigm is like a blueprint to follow to create our projects. You can learn Functional Programming to learn how you can develop programs and solve problems differently. 5. Look at other people's code: In programming, we have many ways to solve problems, maybe another person solved the problem that you have optimally and simply. Looking at other people's minds is essential to advance as a programmer. You have Github to see a lot of great projects. And remember, it is completely normal that you can't resolve a problem, but you must know that the community is a huge place to get helped.",

        "title": "Top 5 Development Technologies for 2022",
        "description": "Developers are always looking for ways to increase their efficiency and improve their applications. When it comes to the top app and web technologies, 2022 is the best year yet. This guide provides an overview of app and web development technologies that can help you increase productivity without compromising the quality of your finished product. 1. Javascript: JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world. Unlike CSS and HTML, which are used to establish the structure and style of webpages, JavaScript is used to create interactive elements. These interactive pages are much more engaging than static pages, making JavaScript extremely useful for any company that wants to encourage users to interact with its online resources. 2. Python: Python is an object-oriented programming language with a variety of uses. It's often used for Rapid Application Development, a development model that de-emphasizes planning and focuses on using adaptive processes to create software and websites. As a high-level language, it's fairly easy to learn if you have programming experience and is a favorite for data scientists to write their data analysis scripts. It's also an open-source language, meaning it's affordable and has an extensive amount of documentation available to help developers solve problems. As a bonus, Python is easier to use than many other programming languages, making it a real-time saver. 3. ReactJS: ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to create stunning user interfaces for dynamic web applications. A key advantage of using this technology is that it produces pieces of HTML code that can be used over and over again, eliminating the need to write new code for the same functions. ReactJS also uses the Virtual DOM, eliminating the performance issues that can occur when a developer writes directly to a web browser's DOM. 4. Node.js: Node.js is an open-source server environment that runs on multiple operating systems. Many developers use Node.js instead of ASP or PHP because Node.js handles file requests faster than the other two technologies. It is typically used to collect data from forms, access files on a server, and add, edit or delete the data in a database. 5. React Native w/ Typescript: React Native allows app developers to build on their JavaScript knowledge without compromising the user's experience, making it one of the top app technologies in 2022 for cross-platform development. One major advantage of this technology is that it translates the developer's markup to native UI elements. Developers typically use React Native with TypeScript, a language that builds on JavaScript.",

        "title": "JavaScript vs. Python",
        "description": "Programming languages for software developers are tools used to create applications with a specific function. In this article, we will study two very famous languages that have been leading the market, JavaScript and Python! JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex functions on web pages. JavaScript allows the user to interact with the web page. In web development, everything that the client can see and interact with on a page is called the Frontend, and JavaScript along with HTML and CSS are the necessary elements for it to work. Javascript is also used on the backend (server side) where the user does not have access and the application logic is managed. It is used through NodeJS which is an event-driven environment designed to create scalable applications, it allows you to establish and manage multiple connections at the same time. JavaScript also allows you to build mobile, desktop, and video game applications on the web through certain libraries such as React Native, PixyJS, BabylonJS, Electron, etc. Python is a general-purpose, interpreted, high-level programming language. In recent years, it has grown even more thanks to the fact that it is the ideal language to work in areas such as Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data, among other areas that are currently on the rise. Python is also widely used in the DevOps role due to the ease it offers when automating tasks, and server-side web applications with frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc. In video games, with libraries like Pygame, PyOpenGL, etc. Besides, it is the preferred language to instruct people in the world of programming, all thanks to its ease of reading and writing. Both languages are incredibly popular, many courses allow you to learn them professionally and they have great libraries that will facilitate the work of any developer. Choosing one or the other will depend on what you want to be in the future, the purpose of the project, and the skills of the work team around you. If you desire to go to the Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence branch, it is best to learn Python because it is well trained for this with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, sci-kit-learn, etc. If you want to focus on the mobile world, you should go for JavaScript and use libraries like React Native or Ionic. If you want to go for the DevOps branch, Python is the best choice due to its ability to automate. If you want to focus on web development, JavaScript will undoubtedly be your tool on the frontend, but on the backend, both have good capabilities and it will depend more on the skills of your team and the purpose of the project",

        "title": "The Complete Reference to Competitive Programming",
        "description": "Choose a Programming Language: Firstly, you need to choose a programming language that you are most comfortable with and learn its syntax. It can be anything C, C++, Java, Python, or any programming language. Understand the Concept of Time and Space Complexity: In most cases, there is more than one solution that exists to a problem, so you need to come up with the best solution, i.e an optimal one, and that's decided by how much time and space an algorithm takes to solve a problem. So it's really important to learn about these two concepts to write an optimal solution to the problem. Learning the Fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms: DSA is the heart of programming and you can not ignore it while solving coding problems in competitive programming. Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Trie, Graph, Sorting, Recursion, Dynamic Programming all these basic building blocks of DSA will help you to become a good programmer. Take the Challenge and Solve Coding Problems: Finally, you need to take part in coding challenges on different coding platforms. Before participating in a contest it would be great if you practiced for some challenges on your own and then participate there. Start from the basic level and once you build the confidence, get out of your comfort zone and gradually try to solve the complex problems. Practice and Do it Regularly: Your patience, dedication, and consistency are very important for becoming a good competitive programmer. Keep practicing the coding questions every single day. The important thing is to do it regularly. Programming needs a lot of patience, so don't get discouraged, or DO NOT GIVE UP IF YOU GET WRONG ANSWERS. This is the point where most people lose interest in programming. Keep trying for a day, week, or months if a voice inside your head says that your method is right. If you can't find a solution google it, ask for help if you don't get the topic, and read the various approaches that coders took to solve the problem but don't quit. Also, you can read the solution only if you are completely sure that you have made a lot of effort and now you can't do anything. But make sure to code again the same problem. You will start improving day by day only and only if you maintain your consistency and don't stop.",

        "title": "Why is Breakfast Important? Our Dietitian gives Healthy Breakfast Ideas",
        "description": "Plenty of studies have been conducted on whether breakfast is necessary. The consensus is yes, breakfast is important and what you choose for breakfast is even more important. Keep in mind, a study was published a few years ago that breakfasts high in refined sugars and carbohydrates can do more damage than good. How can breakfast benefit your health? Eating breakfast regularly has been shown to help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. There's also evidence that eating a healthy breakfast helps with brain function, especially memory and focus. Breakfast Foods to Eat and Avoid - Many studies on breakfast foods have one over-arching theme: what you eat for your morning meal is the most important. Sugary cereals, pastries, bagels, along with high fat, processed meats tend to be popular breakfast food items. Research shows that having a high-fiber breakfast along with a good amount of protein and some heart-healthy fats leads to better health. Start with breakfast cereal If you don't have a lot of time in the mornings, a high-fiber cereal with low added sugar can provide your body with a good start to the day. Buy cereals with at least 5 grams of fiber. Many breakfast cereals have added protein to help pump up your protein intake. These cereals are often made from whole grains, which give your body many vitamins and minerals such as iron and folic acid. What breakfast foods are high in protein? EGGS - Many breakfast meats are high in sodium and saturated fat, which could increase your low-density lipoprotein (LDL, otherwise known as “bad”) cholesterol levels. Instead, swap that meat for a hard-boiled egg. Eggs contain protein and fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins D and E. If you want to consume less cholesterol, egg whites also provide a lot of protein without any added fat and cholesterol. A breakfast sandwich made up of a whole grain English muffin, one egg and a slice of tomato or avocado is a balanced breakfast that will keep you going all morning. YOGURT - Plain yogurt is another great option for an easy high-protein breakfast. By choosing unsweetened yogurt, you can control how much sweetener you would like to add. Frozen fruit is an easy way to sweeten your yogurt. Thaw the fruit overnight in the fridge and then add to yogurt in the morning, along with a little sprinkle of some high-fiber cereal. LEGUMES -Legumes (peas and beans) are a delicious and unique way to add plant-based protein to your morning. Garbanzo bean flour can be used to make pancakes. Just add in your favorite fruit filling for a healthy sweet breakfast. NUTS - Last but not least, nuts can make a great addition to any breakfast. You can make a homemade breakfast bar with whole grain flour or oats, nuts and dried fruit for an easy grab-and-go meal.",

        "title": "Some of the Best Areas to Stay in Maui Hawaii",
        "description": "Maui is a fairly large island (land area of 735 square miles, 48 miles long and 26 miles wide; the second largest Hawaiian island). It can take a while to get from one part of the island to another. To make the most of your time and have an enjoyable experience, it's best to choose the area to stay based on your interests and planned activities. Renting a car is the best way to get around the island. Driving on Maui is scenic and fun; most roads are wide, open and no heavy traffic/freeways. If you plan on doing the Road to Hana, avoid getting a large car as the roads get quite narrow and twisty close to Hana. WEST/NORTHWEST MAUI (LAHAINA, KA'ANAPALI, KAPALUA, NAPILI, HONOLUA); Best for: beaches, snorkeling. This area is well known for beautiful beaches with luxury resorts. Some of the best snorkeling spots to swim with Honu ( Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles) are in west Maui. Historic Lahaina Town is a must-visit; enjoy local food, art galleries, boutique shops on Front Street. Don't forget to go to Foodland and try their delicious poke. SOUTH MAUI (KIHEI, WAILEA) Best for: condos, beaches &amp; getting around the island Wailea has luxury resorts and is less crowded than Ka'anapali (in the west) for the most part. Kihei is north of Wailea and has many condos for those opt to stay in them and they are less expensive than the ones in the west. Kihei and Wailea both have good beaches for families. Many prefer to stay in this area for easy access to other parts of the island. EAST MAUI (ALONG HANA HIGHWAY; PAIA, HAIKU) /NORTH SHORE; Best for: local life experience, beaches, scenic viewpoints, waterfalls Paia is a laid-back surfer town with an 'old Hawaii' feel. Unofficial starting/ending point of 'Road to Hana', it's a relaxing place to spend a day browsing at boutique shops, art galleries and dining at the local eateries and cafes. Haiku is a cute little town (about 20 minutes from Paia) where you can experience how the locals really live (stay at a bnb). Don't miss stopping at Ho'okipa Lookout for the breathtaking view of the shoreline and Honu (Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles). Many scenic viewpoints and waterfalls are on Hana Highway. UPCOUNTRY MAUI (KULA, HALEAKALA); Best for: being away from it all, mountains, pastures, Haleakala National Park. This is a totally different area of Maui, away from the beaches and tourists. Go to Kula Saturday Farmer's Market for fresh and organic produce, farm stands with local foods and baked goods, crafts, plants and more. Sunrise/sunset at Haleakala is definitely an experience of a lifetime! Staying at an bnb is the best option in this area.",

        "title": "Key Points to Improve Your Programming Logic",
        "description": "Logic in programming is a fundamental key to being a good developer. The use of algorithms will vary considering what job you have. If you are a web designer probably you are not going to deal with complex algorithms, but if you are a front-end developer maybe a little more, and if you are a back-end developer much more. So here are 5 points to improve your logic in programming. Think to solve: Programming is about solving problems, a good technique is to split the big problem into small ones to focus on each problem in a better way, you can use pseudocode in a program or a simple paper. Practice: The most important point is this: practice. An algorithm is nothing more than an ordered and finite set of operations that we carry out for the sole purpose of finding a solution to a problem. So try to practice simple problems to get a better logic. Learn about Data Structures and Algorithms: Learning about structures will give you a better plan to focus your problems and have efficient software. You can play games like Chess and practice Mathematics. Learn programming paradigms: A very good point is to learn programming paradigms. Probably one of the most programming paradigms is The Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP). A programming paradigm is like a blueprint to follow to create our projects. You can learn Functional Programming to learn how you can develop programs and solve problems differently. Look at other people's code: In programming, we have many ways to solve problems, maybe another person solved the problem that you have optimally and simply. Looking at other people's minds is essential to advance as a programmer. You have Github to see a lot of great projects. And remember, it is completely normal that you can't resolve a problem, but you must know that the community is a huge place to get helped.",

        "title": "Our Curated Guide To The Most Amazing Things To Do In Cappadocia",
        "description": "Cappadocia, deep in the heart of Turkey, is a place of unique landscapes. Rocks, sculpted over the years by wind and water, form a canvas of magnificent scenery; half-domed white rocks cling to valley tops, rippling rose canyons scar the earth and phallic rock formations reach for the sky. Our guide to the best things to do in Cappadocia covers the highlights from our itinerary, where to stay, how to get around and our tips for getting the most out of this incredible destination. [HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE] On still days, as the sun rises over the mountains of Cappadocia and lights up the tall cone-like rocks, hundreds of hot air balloons take to the skies. A myriad of colours, they drift in and out of the rippling canyons of rock, before rising towards the heavens and returning to earth. With the sun illuminating the valley walls and masses of balloons floating around you, taking a hot air balloon ride is one of the most magical things to do in Cappadocia. [SUNSET POINT] Just a few hundred metres from the centre of Göreme, Sunset Point (also called Lover's Hill or Aşiklar Tepesi) is the perfect place to take in dawn or sunset at Cappadocia. At sunset, there's a small café serving beer and tables scattered around to watch as a fiery orange and red glow illuminates the strangely shaped rock formations. You won't have the place to yourself, but it's a wonderful thing to do in Cappadocia. [HIKE PIGEON &amp; LOVE VALLEY] Cappadocia is one of our favourite hiking destinations and a walk combining Pigeon Valley and Love Valley sees some of the best and most diverse scenery in the area. Paths lead through moulded rock formation, smoothed into wave-like shapes, then burst into colour with long grass and wildflowers in full bloom. [STAY IN A CAVE HOTEL] Many of the caves in Cappadocia were originally carved out of the soft rock by early Christians fleeing persecution. Other cave dwellings were possibly used by early humans taking advantage of the unique topography. [GÖREME OPEN AIR MUSEUM] The Göreme Open Air Museum is a coll ction of 10th to 12th-century churches carved out of the rock. The churches are peppered with frescoes demonstrating the significance these hideouts had for early Christians. BEST TIME TO VISIT CAPPADOCIA - The best time to visit Cappadocia is the shoulder seasons from April to June, and from September to October. Cappadocia sits on a plateau over 1,000 metres high, so in winter the temperature can drop to around 0°C and in summer it's often upwards of 30°C. Rainfall is higher in Spring than in Autumn, and being a little windier, this makes balloon riding a bit more susceptible to cancellations. The upside is the landscape is greener, flowers more abundant and the days longer. We travelled during Ramadan which meant the valleys were much less busy as locals don't take holiday during this time. We also had no problems booking hotels late (so we could keep some flexibility) or getting into good restaurants with the best viewpoints.",

        "title": "Some of the Top Development Technologies for 2022",
        "description": "Developers are always looking for ways to increase their efficiency and improve their applications. When it comes to the top app and web technologies, 2022 is the best year yet. This guide provides an overview of app and web development technologies that can help you increase productivity without compromising the quality of your finished product. Javascript: JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world. Unlike CSS and HTML, which are used to establish the structure and style of webpages, JavaScript is used to create interactive elements. These interactive pages are much more engaging than static pages, making JavaScript extremely useful for any company that wants to encourage users to interact with its online resources. Python: Python is an object-oriented programming language with a variety of uses. It's often used for Rapid Application Development, a development model that de-emphasizes planning and focuses on using adaptive processes to create software and websites. As a high-level language, it's fairly easy to learn if you have programming experience and is a favorite for data scientists to write their data analysis scripts. It's also an open-source language, meaning it's affordable and has an extensive amount of documentation available to help developers solve problems. As a bonus, Python is easier to use than many other programming languages, making it a real-time saver. ReactJS: ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to create stunning user interfaces for dynamic web applications. A key advantage of using this technology is that it produces pieces of HTML code that can be used over and over again, eliminating the need to write new code for the same functions. ReactJS also uses the Virtual DOM, eliminating the performance issues that can occur when a developer writes directly to a web browser's DOM. Node.js: Node.js is an open-source server environment that runs on multiple operating systems. Many developers use Node.js instead of ASP or PHP because Node.js handles file requests faster than the other two technologies. It is typically used to collect data from forms, access files on a server, and add, edit or delete the data in a database. React Native w/ Typescript: React Native allows app developers to build on their JavaScript knowledge without compromising the user's experience, making it one of the top app technologies in 2022 for cross-platform development. One major advantage of this technology is that it translates the developer's markup to native UI elements. Developers typically use React Native with TypeScript, a language that builds on JavaScript.",

        "title": "Stuðlagil Canyon - Viewpoints At Iceland's Best Basalt Columns",
        "description": "Stuðlagil Canyon is a stunning gorge lined with basalt columns and one of Iceland's prime Instagram hot spots. Here's how to see one of the country's most recent natural attractions. WHERE IS STUÐLAGIL CANYON? Stuðlagil Canyon is in the Jokuldalur Valley in eastern Iceland. It's 70 kilometres (43 miles) from the town of Egilsstaðir; 140 kilometres (87 miles) from the popular tourist destination of Myvatn; and 600 kilometres (372 miles) from Reykjavík. The giant basalt canyon was completely submerged under the river Jökulsá á Brú (also called Jökulsá á Dal, or Jökla). This fierce glacial river, the longest in eastern Iceland, was tamed after the construction of the Kárahnjúkar Hydrpower Plant in 2009 which saw the water levels drop by 7 to 8 meters. HOW TO SEE THE BEST OF STUÐLAGIL CANYON There are basalt columns all the way along the Jökla River. You can see them as you drive along the Jökuldalsvegur road which runs along the western edge of the canyon. The best section of the canyon is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) down Jökuldalsvegur road from the junction of Route 1 - Iceland's Ring Road. WEST BANK STUÐLAGIL CANYON VIEWS To get views of the basalt columns at Stuðlagil Canyon from the west side turn down Route 923 (from Route 1) and shortly afterwards turn onto Jökuldalsvegur. This gravel road is in good condition and easily navigable in a 2WD car. After 20 kilometres (12 miles) turn left at a sign for Grund Farm and park in the large parking lot (called Stuðlagil Canyon in Google Maps and marked in blue on the map below). EAST BANK STUÐLAGIL CANYON VIEWS From the east bank, you can hike down to the river and look into the heart of Stuðlagil Canyon. There are 2 parking places to start the hike. [STUÐLAGIL EAST SIDE PARKING] (1-HOUR WALK) From Route 1, turn down Route 923 and then onto Jökuldalsvegur. After 15 kilometres (20 minutes driving) turn left at a sign for Klausturserl. You quickly come to a small parking lot (called Stuðlagil East Side Parking in Google) just before a bridge over the river. [PARKPLATZ KLASTRUSEL (30-MINUTE WALK) Crossing the bridge over the river, a bumpy road continues on the other side to a parking lot (called Parkplatz Klastrusel in Google). If you have a 4x4 vehicle it takes 7 or 8 minutes to drive to Parkplatz Klastrusel. If you have a 2WD it is a much less pleasant journey (but many still make it). From here it is a 30-minute walk (1 hour return) to the viewpoint over the basalt canyon. Facilities: There are no toilets at Parkplatz Klastrusel, but there is sometimes a food van selling slushies, waffles and hot dogs. [STUÐLAGIL EAST VIEWPOINT]From the viewpoint you can also descend down to the river, which will grant you excellent viewsof the giant columns of basalt rising above your head as turquoise waters flow past your feet. It's a short, but slightly tricky scramble (5 minutes) where you'll need your hands in a couple of places. Beware it can be quite muddy after rain. WHEN TO VISIT STUÐLAGIL CANYON - The best time to visit Stuðlagil Canyon is during the summer months of June, July &amp; August. The temperatures are mild, the hiking trails are clear of snow, and the river is most likely to be a wonderful blue colour. In winter, getting here can be a challenge and the river and canyon can be covered in snow and ice. In spring the snowmelt brings sediment down the valley turning the river brown; and in fall, the hydroelectric dam releases its overflow producing higher water levels and a more churned-up river. Finally, Stuðlagil Canyon has rapidly become an Instagram spot, so queueing up at the edge of the river to get your photo can take time. We highly recommend coming early or late in the day.",

        "title": "JavaScript vs. Python",
        "description": "Programming languages for software developers are tools used to create applications with a specific function. In this article, we will study two very famous languages that have been leading the market, JavaScript and Python! JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex functions on web pages. JavaScript allows the user to interact with the web page. In web development, everything that the client can see and interact with on a page is called the Frontend, and JavaScript along with HTML and CSS are the necessary elements for it to work. Javascript is also used on the backend (server side) where the user does not have access and the application logic is managed. It is used through NodeJS which is an event-driven environment designed to create scalable applications, it allows you to establish and manage multiple connections at the same time. JavaScript also allows you to build mobile, desktop, and video game applications on the web through certain libraries such as React Native, PixyJS, BabylonJS, Electron, etc. Python is a general-purpose, interpreted, high-level programming language. In recent years, it has grown even more thanks to the fact that it is the ideal language to work in areas such as Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data, among other areas that are currently on the rise. Python is also widely used in the DevOps role due to the ease it offers when automating tasks, and server-side web applications with frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc. In video games, with libraries like Pygame, PyOpenGL, etc. Besides, it is the preferred language to instruct people in the world of programming, all thanks to its ease of reading and writing. Both languages are incredibly popular, many courses allow you to learn them professionally and they have great libraries that will facilitate the work of any developer. Choosing one or the other will depend on what you want to be in the future, the purpose of the project, and the skills of the work team around you. If you desire to go to the Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence branch, it is best to learn Python because it is well trained for this with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, sci-kit-learn, etc. If you want to focus on the mobile world, you should go for JavaScript and use libraries like React Native or Ionic. If you want to go for the DevOps branch, Python is the best choice due to its ability to automate. If you want to focus on web development, JavaScript will undoubtedly be your tool on the frontend, but on the backend, both have good capabilities and it will depend more on the skills of your team and the purpose of the project",

        "title": "The Best Things To Do In Essaouira, Morocco",
        "description": "Essaouira is an escape from the chaos of other Moroccan towns with a seaside vibe that has a relaxed charm and plenty of character. Here are the best things to do in Essaouira. Beneath the energy, a chilled vibe spreads throughout the small town. Art galleries hide down narrow side streets and cafes line shaded pavements. It's a mile away from the chaos of other Moroccan cities, and all the better for it. WANDER THE ESSAOUIRA MEDINA - The small laneways of Essaouira are charming and atmospheric with a blend of local and tourist haunts that fit together perfectly. It's not as crazy as the exotic medina of Fez and it doesn't have the big attractions of Marrakech, but there is plenty to enjoy in the unique Essaouira way. In the west of the medina, the Skala de la Ville protects Essaouira from the Atlantic. The views from its fortress-like walls are excellent. An energetic woodworker's market, selling all sorts of practical (and not so practical) goods, is tucked just underneath. VISIT THE FISH AUCTION AT SKALA DU PORT - Just beyond the southern gate to the medina lies the buzzing harbour, Skala du Port, which is one of the iconic places to visit in Essaouira. Hundreds of blue boats bob up and down in the small harbour, nestled against the honey-colour walls of the ramparts. Each day they make the journey into the Atlantic to return packed with fish. In the afternoon, the fish auction takes place where you can you can haggle for the day's catch. With the vibrant banter of the market as the sun sets over the marina, it's one of the most magical things to do in Essaouira. STROLL THE RAMPARTS - The huge stone wall circling Essaouira was built in the 18th century to protect the city from foreign invaders. Today, walking along the ramparts, particularly at sunset, is one of the best things to do in Essaouira. The ramparts were designed by French architect, Théodore Cornut and it's not hard to see the connection with imperial-looking defensive stations and prominent arches. PERUSE ESSAOUIRA'S THRIVING ART SCENE - For decades, Essaouira has attracted artists from all over Morocco, lured by the unique light and colour of the ancient medina. There are numerous galleries dotted about town dedicated to the local flair for creativity. KITE SURF ON ESSAOUIRA BEACH - There is a fierce wind that rushes off the Atlantic and batters Essaouira relentlessly. There are not many days you can lie on the beach without being sand blasted. So instead, hire some kite-surfing equipment and head out for a different Essaouira Beach experience. BEST TIME TO VISIT ESSAOUIRA - The best time to visit Essaouira is between May and September when the south Atlantic breeze keeps the temperatures much more bearable than other Moroccan cities. Average temperatures in summer are around 28°C (82°F). July and August is the peak time for local tourists escaping the gruelling heat of the main cities, causing accommodation prices to rise. It's also the windiest time. Heavy rain is rare in Essaouira but drizzly days, particularly throughout January and February are not. Average temperatures in winter are around 19°C (66°F) making Essaouira a potential destination for catching some sun, however, the strong winds can often make it feel much colder than it is.",

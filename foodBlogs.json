        "description": "Plenty of studies have been conducted on whether breakfast is necessary. The consensus is yes, breakfast is important and what you choose for breakfast is even more important. Keep in mind, a study was published a few years ago that breakfasts high in refined sugars and carbohydrates can do more damage than good. How can breakfast benefit your health? Eating breakfast regularly has been shown to help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. There's also evidence that eating a healthy breakfast helps with brain function, especially memory and focus. Breakfast Foods to Eat and Avoid - Many studies on breakfast foods have one over-arching theme: what you eat for your morning meal is the most important. Sugary cereals, pastries, bagels, along with high fat, processed meats tend to be popular breakfast food items. Research shows that having a high-fiber breakfast along with a good amount of protein and some heart-healthy fats leads to better health. Start with breakfast cereal If you don't have a lot of time in the mornings, a high-fiber cereal with low added sugar can provide your body with a good start to the day. Buy cereals with at least 5 grams of fiber. Many breakfast cereals have added protein to help pump up your protein intake. These cereals are often made from whole grains, which give your body many vitamins and minerals such as iron and folic acid. What breakfast foods are high in protein? EGGS - Many breakfast meats are high in sodium and saturated fat, which could increase your low-density lipoprotein (LDL, otherwise known as “bad”) cholesterol levels. Instead, swap that meat for a hard-boiled egg. Eggs contain protein and fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins D and E. If you want to consume less cholesterol, egg whites also provide a lot of protein without any added fat and cholesterol. A breakfast sandwich made up of a whole grain English muffin, one egg and a slice of tomato or avocado is a balanced breakfast that will keep you going all morning. YOGURT - Plain yogurt is another great option for an easy high-protein breakfast. By choosing unsweetened yogurt, you can control how much sweetener you would like to add. Frozen fruit is an easy way to sweeten your yogurt. Thaw the fruit overnight in the fridge and then add to yogurt in the morning, along with a little sprinkle of some high-fiber cereal. LEGUMES -Legumes (peas and beans) are a delicious and unique way to add plant-based protein to your morning. Garbanzo bean flour can be used to make pancakes. Just add in your favorite fruit filling for a healthy sweet breakfast. NUTS - Last but not least, nuts can make a great addition to any breakfast. You can make a homemade breakfast bar with whole grain flour or oats, nuts and dried fruit for an easy grab-and-go meal.",

        "title": "Some of the Best Areas to Stay in Maui Hawaii",
        "description": "Maui is a fairly large island (land area of 735 square miles, 48 miles long and 26 miles wide; the second largest Hawaiian island). It can take a while to get from one part of the island to another. To make the most of your time and have an enjoyable experience, it's best to choose the area to stay based on your interests and planned activities. Renting a car is the best way to get around the island. Driving on Maui is scenic and fun; most roads are wide, open and no heavy traffic/freeways. If you plan on doing the Road to Hana, avoid getting a large car as the roads get quite narrow and twisty close to Hana. WEST/NORTHWEST MAUI (LAHAINA, KA'ANAPALI, KAPALUA, NAPILI, HONOLUA); Best for: beaches, snorkeling. This area is well known for beautiful beaches with luxury resorts. Some of the best snorkeling spots to swim with Honu ( Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles) are in west Maui. Historic Lahaina Town is a must-visit; enjoy local food, art galleries, boutique shops on Front Street. Don't forget to go to Foodland and try their delicious poke. SOUTH MAUI (KIHEI, WAILEA) Best for: condos, beaches &amp; getting around the island Wailea has luxury resorts and is less crowded than Ka'anapali (in the west) for the most part. Kihei is north of Wailea and has many condos for those opt to stay in them and they are less expensive than the ones in the west. Kihei and Wailea both have good beaches for families. Many prefer to stay in this area for easy access to other parts of the island. EAST MAUI (ALONG HANA HIGHWAY; PAIA, HAIKU) /NORTH SHORE; Best for: local life experience, beaches, scenic viewpoints, waterfalls Paia is a laid-back surfer town with an 'old Hawaii' feel. Unofficial starting/ending point of 'Road to Hana', it's a relaxing place to spend a day browsing at boutique shops, art galleries and dining at the local eateries and cafes. Haiku is a cute little town (about 20 minutes from Paia) where you can experience how the locals really live (stay at a bnb). Don't miss stopping at Ho'okipa Lookout for the breathtaking view of the shoreline and Honu (Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles). Many scenic viewpoints and waterfalls are on Hana Highway. UPCOUNTRY MAUI (KULA, HALEAKALA); Best for: being away from it all, mountains, pastures, Haleakala National Park. This is a totally different area of Maui, away from the beaches and tourists. Go to Kula Saturday Farmer's Market for fresh and organic produce, farm stands with local foods and baked goods, crafts, plants and more. Sunrise/sunset at Haleakala is definitely an experience of a lifetime! Staying at an bnb is the best option in this area.",

        "title": "Our Curated Guide To The Most Amazing Things To Do In Cappadocia",
        "description": "Cappadocia, deep in the heart of Turkey, is a place of unique landscapes. Rocks, sculpted over the years by wind and water, form a canvas of magnificent scenery; half-domed white rocks cling to valley tops, rippling rose canyons scar the earth and phallic rock formations reach for the sky. Our guide to the best things to do in Cappadocia covers the highlights from our itinerary, where to stay, how to get around and our tips for getting the most out of this incredible destination. [HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE] On still days, as the sun rises over the mountains of Cappadocia and lights up the tall cone-like rocks, hundreds of hot air balloons take to the skies. A myriad of colours, they drift in and out of the rippling canyons of rock, before rising towards the heavens and returning to earth. With the sun illuminating the valley walls and masses of balloons floating around you, taking a hot air balloon ride is one of the most magical things to do in Cappadocia. [SUNSET POINT] Just a few hundred metres from the centre of Göreme, Sunset Point (also called Lover's Hill or Aşiklar Tepesi) is the perfect place to take in dawn or sunset at Cappadocia. At sunset, there's a small café serving beer and tables scattered around to watch as a fiery orange and red glow illuminates the strangely shaped rock formations. You won't have the place to yourself, but it's a wonderful thing to do in Cappadocia. [HIKE PIGEON &amp; LOVE VALLEY] Cappadocia is one of our favourite hiking destinations and a walk combining Pigeon Valley and Love Valley sees some of the best and most diverse scenery in the area. Paths lead through moulded rock formation, smoothed into wave-like shapes, then burst into colour with long grass and wildflowers in full bloom. [STAY IN A CAVE HOTEL] Many of the caves in Cappadocia were originally carved out of the soft rock by early Christians fleeing persecution. Other cave dwellings were possibly used by early humans taking advantage of the unique topography. [GÖREME OPEN AIR MUSEUM] The Göreme Open Air Museum is a coll ction of 10th to 12th-century churches carved out of the rock. The churches are peppered with frescoes demonstrating the significance these hideouts had for early Christians. BEST TIME TO VISIT CAPPADOCIA - The best time to visit Cappadocia is the shoulder seasons from April to June, and from September to October. Cappadocia sits on a plateau over 1,000 metres high, so in winter the temperature can drop to around 0°C and in summer it's often upwards of 30°C. Rainfall is higher in Spring than in Autumn, and being a little windier, this makes balloon riding a bit more susceptible to cancellations. The upside is the landscape is greener, flowers more abundant and the days longer. We travelled during Ramadan which meant the valleys were much less busy as locals don't take holiday during this time. We also had no problems booking hotels late (so we could keep some flexibility) or getting into good restaurants with the best viewpoints.",

        "title": "Stuðlagil Canyon - Viewpoints At Iceland's Best Basalt Columns",
        "description": "Stuðlagil Canyon is a stunning gorge lined with basalt columns and one of Iceland's prime Instagram hot spots. Here's how to see one of the country's most recent natural attractions. WHERE IS STUÐLAGIL CANYON? Stuðlagil Canyon is in the Jokuldalur Valley in eastern Iceland. It's 70 kilometres (43 miles) from the town of Egilsstaðir; 140 kilometres (87 miles) from the popular tourist destination of Myvatn; and 600 kilometres (372 miles) from Reykjavík. The giant basalt canyon was completely submerged under the river Jökulsá á Brú (also called Jökulsá á Dal, or Jökla). This fierce glacial river, the longest in eastern Iceland, was tamed after the construction of the Kárahnjúkar Hydrpower Plant in 2009 which saw the water levels drop by 7 to 8 meters. HOW TO SEE THE BEST OF STUÐLAGIL CANYON There are basalt columns all the way along the Jökla River. You can see them as you drive along the Jökuldalsvegur road which runs along the western edge of the canyon. The best section of the canyon is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) down Jökuldalsvegur road from the junction of Route 1 - Iceland's Ring Road. WEST BANK STUÐLAGIL CANYON VIEWS To get views of the basalt columns at Stuðlagil Canyon from the west side turn down Route 923 (from Route 1) and shortly afterwards turn onto Jökuldalsvegur. This gravel road is in good condition and easily navigable in a 2WD car. After 20 kilometres (12 miles) turn left at a sign for Grund Farm and park in the large parking lot (called Stuðlagil Canyon in Google Maps and marked in blue on the map below). EAST BANK STUÐLAGIL CANYON VIEWS From the east bank, you can hike down to the river and look into the heart of Stuðlagil Canyon. There are 2 parking places to start the hike. [STUÐLAGIL EAST SIDE PARKING] (1-HOUR WALK) From Route 1, turn down Route 923 and then onto Jökuldalsvegur. After 15 kilometres (20 minutes driving) turn left at a sign for Klausturserl. You quickly come to a small parking lot (called Stuðlagil East Side Parking in Google) just before a bridge over the river. [PARKPLATZ KLASTRUSEL (30-MINUTE WALK) Crossing the bridge over the river, a bumpy road continues on the other side to a parking lot (called Parkplatz Klastrusel in Google). If you have a 4x4 vehicle it takes 7 or 8 minutes to drive to Parkplatz Klastrusel. If you have a 2WD it is a much less pleasant journey (but many still make it). From here it is a 30-minute walk (1 hour return) to the viewpoint over the basalt canyon. Facilities: There are no toilets at Parkplatz Klastrusel, but there is sometimes a food van selling slushies, waffles and hot dogs. [STUÐLAGIL EAST VIEWPOINT]From the viewpoint you can also descend down to the river, which will grant you excellent viewsof the giant columns of basalt rising above your head as turquoise waters flow past your feet. It's a short, but slightly tricky scramble (5 minutes) where you'll need your hands in a couple of places. Beware it can be quite muddy after rain. WHEN TO VISIT STUÐLAGIL CANYON - The best time to visit Stuðlagil Canyon is during the summer months of June, July &amp; August. The temperatures are mild, the hiking trails are clear of snow, and the river is most likely to be a wonderful blue colour. In winter, getting here can be a challenge and the river and canyon can be covered in snow and ice. In spring the snowmelt brings sediment down the valley turning the river brown; and in fall, the hydroelectric dam releases its overflow producing higher water levels and a more churned-up river. Finally, Stuðlagil Canyon has rapidly become an Instagram spot, so queueing up at the edge of the river to get your photo can take time. We highly recommend coming early or late in the day.",

        "title": "The Best Things To Do In Essaouira, Morocco",
        "description": "Essaouira is an escape from the chaos of other Moroccan towns with a seaside vibe that has a relaxed charm and plenty of character. Here are the best things to do in Essaouira. Beneath the energy, a chilled vibe spreads throughout the small town. Art galleries hide down narrow side streets and cafes line shaded pavements. It's a mile away from the chaos of other Moroccan cities, and all the better for it. WANDER THE ESSAOUIRA MEDINA - The small laneways of Essaouira are charming and atmospheric with a blend of local and tourist haunts that fit together perfectly. It's not as crazy as the exotic medina of Fez and it doesn't have the big attractions of Marrakech, but there is plenty to enjoy in the unique Essaouira way. In the west of the medina, the Skala de la Ville protects Essaouira from the Atlantic. The views from its fortress-like walls are excellent. An energetic woodworker's market, selling all sorts of practical (and not so practical) goods, is tucked just underneath. VISIT THE FISH AUCTION AT SKALA DU PORT - Just beyond the southern gate to the medina lies the buzzing harbour, Skala du Port, which is one of the iconic places to visit in Essaouira. Hundreds of blue boats bob up and down in the small harbour, nestled against the honey-colour walls of the ramparts. Each day they make the journey into the Atlantic to return packed with fish. In the afternoon, the fish auction takes place where you can you can haggle for the day's catch. With the vibrant banter of the market as the sun sets over the marina, it's one of the most magical things to do in Essaouira. STROLL THE RAMPARTS - The huge stone wall circling Essaouira was built in the 18th century to protect the city from foreign invaders. Today, walking along the ramparts, particularly at sunset, is one of the best things to do in Essaouira. The ramparts were designed by French architect, Théodore Cornut and it's not hard to see the connection with imperial-looking defensive stations and prominent arches. PERUSE ESSAOUIRA'S THRIVING ART SCENE - For decades, Essaouira has attracted artists from all over Morocco, lured by the unique light and colour of the ancient medina. There are numerous galleries dotted about town dedicated to the local flair for creativity. KITE SURF ON ESSAOUIRA BEACH - There is a fierce wind that rushes off the Atlantic and batters Essaouira relentlessly. There are not many days you can lie on the beach without being sand blasted. So instead, hire some kite-surfing equipment and head out for a different Essaouira Beach experience. BEST TIME TO VISIT ESSAOUIRA - The best time to visit Essaouira is between May and September when the south Atlantic breeze keeps the temperatures much more bearable than other Moroccan cities. Average temperatures in summer are around 28°C (82°F). July and August is the peak time for local tourists escaping the gruelling heat of the main cities, causing accommodation prices to rise. It's also the windiest time. Heavy rain is rare in Essaouira but drizzly days, particularly throughout January and February are not. Average temperatures in winter are around 19°C (66°F) making Essaouira a potential destination for catching some sun, however, the strong winds can often make it feel much colder than it is.",
